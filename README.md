This is a small personal project in React - a game for testing your memory. Positions on a grid will be chosen at random and displayed for a few seconds, giving you the chance to memorize their locations. Once they disappear, you must click each "chosen" square without making more than 3 mistakes.

In order to run locally, just clone the repository and run `npm install` and `npm start`
